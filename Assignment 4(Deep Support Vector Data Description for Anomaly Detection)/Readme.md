# OVERVIEW 
In this assignment we will be implementing a algorithm "Deep Support Vector Data Description for Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection" , on a dataset as mentioned in the research paper - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333642118_Deep_Support_Vector_Data_Description_for_Unsupervised_and_Semi-Supervised_Anomaly_Detection
We will be doing Anomaly detection for classes {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and results are shown below .

# Compiling and Executing
1. Upload code.ipynb on Google Collab.
2. Save the dataset (MNIST DATASET) in you drive  and mount it in your colab notebook.
3. Run


# Results:

ROC SCORED FOR EACH CLASS :
