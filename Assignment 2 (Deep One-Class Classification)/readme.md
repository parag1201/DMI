# Overview 
In this assignment we have implemented an algorithm "DEEP SVDD", as proposed by the following presearch paper - http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ruff18a.html. 
Anomaly detection for classes {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} is done and results are as follows:

# Compiling and Executing:
1. Upload code file on Google Collab.
2. Mount and save the dataset (We have used MNIST DATASET, mentioned in the paper ) in you drive.
3. Run the code blocks.

# Results:
ROC SCORED FOR EACH CLASS :
